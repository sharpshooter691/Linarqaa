# Spring Security Fix for Notification Endpoints

## 🔧 **Problem Identified:**
The `/api/notifications/admin/unread` endpoint was returning **403 Forbidden** because:

1. **JWT Authentication Filter** was setting empty authorities (`Collections.emptyList()`)
2. **Spring Security** was rejecting requests because users had no roles/authorities
3. **Admin endpoints** weren't properly configured for role-based access

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Fixed JWT Authentication Filter (`JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`):**
```java
// Before (BROKEN):
.authorities(Collections.emptyList())

// After (FIXED):
List<GrantedAuthority> authorities = List.of(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_" + user.getRole().name()));
.authorities(authorities)
```

**Changes:**
- Added proper role-based authorities (`ROLE_OWNER`, `ROLE_STAFF`)
- Added debug logging to track authentication
- Fixed import statements

### **2. Updated Spring Security Configuration (`SecurityConfig.java`):**
```java
// Added specific rules for notification endpoints:
.requestMatchers("/api/notifications/admin/**").hasRole("OWNER") // Admin-only
.requestMatchers("/api/notifications/**").authenticated() // Regular users
```

**Changes:**
- Admin notification endpoints require `ROLE_OWNER`
- Regular notification endpoints require authentication
- Proper role-based authorization

### **3. Enhanced Notification Controller:**
- Added authentication checks in controller methods
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

### **For Admin Users (OWNER role):**
- ✅ Can access `/api/notifications/admin/unread`
- ✅ Can see admin notifications in the UI
- ✅ JWT token includes `ROLE_OWNER` authority

### **For Staff Users (STAFF role):**
- ✅ Can access `/api/notifications/unread` (their own notifications)
- ❌ Cannot access `/api/notifications/admin/**` (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ JWT token includes `ROLE_STAFF` authority

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**
The system now logs:
```
🔐 JWT Authentication successful for user: admin@example.com with role: OWNER
🔔 NotificationController.getUnreadAdminNotifications() called
✅ Admin user authenticated: admin@example.com
📋 Found X unread admin notifications
```

## 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. **Restart backend server** to apply changes
2. **Login as admin user** 
3. **Check notification bell** - should now work without 403 errors
4. **Monitor console** for debug messages

## 🎯 **Result:**
The notification system should now work correctly with proper Spring Security integration!
