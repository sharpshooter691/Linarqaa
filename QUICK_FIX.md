# Quick Fix for Notification System

## Problem Found
The notification system is working correctly, but there's a database column size issue:
- **Error**: `Data truncated for column 'status' at row 1`
- **Cause**: The `status` column is `VARCHAR(20)` but needs to be `VARCHAR(50)` for enum values like `STUDENT_REGISTERED`

## Solution
Run this SQL command in your MySQL database:

```sql
-- Fix the column size
ALTER TABLE notifications MODIFY COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'UNREAD';
ALTER TABLE notifications MODIFY COLUMN type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
```

## How to Run
1. Open MySQL command line or MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your `linarqa` database
3. Run the SQL command above
4. Test by registering a new student

## Alternative: Run the Fix Script
```bash
mysql -u root -p linarqa < fix-notifications-table.sql
```

## What the Debug Output Shows
From the terminal output, I can see:
- ✅ Authentication working: `admin@linarqa.com` found
- ✅ User lookup working: Found "Ahmed Benali (Role: OWNER)"
- ✅ Admin users found: "Found 1 admin users"
- ✅ Notification creation working: "Creating student registration notification"
- ❌ Database error: Column size too small

## After the Fix
Once you run the SQL command, the notification system should work perfectly:
1. Register a new student
2. Check the notification bell icon in the top bar
3. You should see the notification appear

The system is working correctly - it's just a database schema issue that needs this one-line fix!
